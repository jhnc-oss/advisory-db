[Many functions marked as safe with non-local safety guarantees](https://github.com/aldanor/fast-float-rust/issues/37)\n\nThe library is also unmaintained.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nFor quickly parsing floating-point numbers third-party crates are generally no longer needed. A fast float parsing algorithm by the author of `lexical` has been [merged](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86761) into libcore. When requiring direct parsing from bytes and/or partial parsers, the [`fast-float2`](https://crates.io/crates/fast-float2) fork of `fast-float` containing these security patches and reduces overall usage of unsafe.",
