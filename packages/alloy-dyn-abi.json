    "summary": "DoS vulnerability on `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` hashing",
    "details": "An uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via `eip712_signing_hash()`.\n\nSoftware with high availability requirements such as network services may be particularly impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting mechanisms can partially mitigate the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible.\n\nThe vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version [v1.4.1](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/1.4.1) and backported to [v0.8.26](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/0.8.26).\n\nThere is no known workaround that mitigates the vulnerability. Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended course of action.\n\nReported by [Christian Reitter](https://github.com/cr-tk) & [Zeke Mostov](https://github.com/emostov) from [Turnkey](https://www.turnkey.com/).",
